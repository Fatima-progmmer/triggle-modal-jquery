# Trigger Modal using jQuery

## 📌 Overview
The **Trigger Modal using jQuery** project is a simple implementation of a modal popup that appears when triggered by a button click. It enhances user interaction by displaying additional content without navigating away from the current page.

## 🛠 Features
- Click a button to trigger a modal popup.
- Smooth fade-in and fade-out animations.
- Close the modal by clicking the close button or outside the modal.
- Lightweight and easy to integrate into any project.
- Fully responsive design.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **HTML** - Structure of the modal.
- **CSS** - Styling and animations.
- **jQuery** - Handles opening, closing, and animations for the modal.

## 🔧 Setup & Usage
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Fatima-progmmer/triggle-modal-jquery.git
   ```
2. **Open `index.html` in a browser**
3. Click the trigger button to open the modal popup.
4. Close the modal by clicking outside it or pressing the close button.

## 💡 How it Works
- The modal remains hidden by default.
- When the button is clicked, jQuery makes the modal appear smoothly.
- Clicking outside the modal or on the close button hides it with an animation.

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Add keyboard support (e.g., closing with the `Esc` key).
- Include multiple modal support on the same page.
- Enhance styling with modern UI frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.
